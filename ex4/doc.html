- We compare between the output of the HTTP js module and our code's output to unsure that our program
works well. To show the results we printed the first seven chars from each output to the screen.<br />
- We asked for a non-exist file and checked that the server's output is ok for that case (404 error).<br />
- We tried to get to a path that's forbidden and got from the server a "403 Forbidden" error.
